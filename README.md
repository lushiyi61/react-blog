# react-blog

喜欢的话，记得给一个star

1. 尝试用react开发一个静态Blog
2. 尝试使用typescript开发react项目


Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd blog
  yarn start

Happy hacking!
